Workshop "Digital Scholarly Editions with TEI" (José Luis Losada Palenzuela) 

Exercise 1 - Instructions: 

TOOL (Creating a new TEI-XML File).

- Open oXygen (to open click on “oxYgen XML Editor”).
- Open new document (oXygen menu: File > New document).
- Search or select a document type (Framework templates > TEI P5 > TEI All [TEI P5]).
- Save it and rename it (you may save it just on the desktop into a folder named, e.g.: 'edition').

TRANSCRIPTION.

- Cancel the dummy text "Some text here." between the opening <p> and the closing </p> within the <body> element. 
- Transcribe from the scan the sonnet in Polish  (... or use the transcription provided).
- Insert (or transcribe directly) the text into the opening <p> and the closing </p>.

The document should be now well-formed (a green square is visible in the upper right-hand corner) 

ENCODING.

You are encoding a sonnet, so you need to add these elements:

<l>: verse line 
<lg>: line group (verse lines functioning as a formal unit, e.g.: sonnet: 14 verses lines; quatrain: 4 verses lines; tercet: 3 verses lines). 

- Start canceling the opening <p> and the closing </p>, we don't need them for a sonnet.
- Don't worry about the red square (it means the document is not, yet, well-formed.)  
- Surround the first verse line with a the opening <l> and the closing </l>. Proceed the same way with all lines (you can try a shortcut: Highlight the verse line, press control-e, and in the contextual menu type 'l', for the element name).

The document should be now well-formed (a green square is visible in the upper right-hand corner)

- Now encode all line groups, i.e., the sonnet, the 2 quatrains and 3 tercets. Surround with <lg> </lg> all verses lines (that is the whole sonnet) and go on successively for each quatrain and tercet. The structure should look like:

<lg>
<lg>
   	<l>...</l>
	<l>...</l>
    <l>...</l>
	<l>...</l>
  </lg>
		...
  </lg>

(Have a look at the file provided "1.2-Lope-Soneto-empty.xml" if you have trouble getting it done).  


- Add now the attributes to markup the strophes and the number lines (remember to add the quotation marks):

<lg type="soneto">: line group for the whole poem.
<lg type="cuarteto">: line group for a quatrain.
<lg type="terceto">: line group for a tercet.
<l n="1">: verse line number. 

VISUALIZATION (web browser and oXygen editor mode).

- Associate a css stylesheet by copying and pasting the following instruction just before the <TEI> root element: <?xml-stylesheet type="text/css" href="visualize-tei-xml.css"?> (Eventually you can also go to the oXygen menu: Document > XML Document > Associate XSLT/CSS Stylesheet; Browse for the local file "visualize-tei-xml.css" provided in the materials and add it).
- Open your encoded XML-TEI file it in the web browser (drag and drop into the browser may just work fine).
- Other way to visualize is to toggle the "Author mode" in oXygen (look for the 3 tabs "Text, Grid, Author" in the bottom of the window).
- Familiar with CSS stylesheet? Open it in oXygen and play around with it.

PUBLICATION.

We can generate a html (web page document) from of our TEI-XML file.

- In the oXygen menu bar go to Document > Transformation > Configure transformation scenarios.
- Choose "TEI P5 XHTML" and click on "Apply associated".
- Your html document should be now in the same location where you save your XML-TEI file.
- Open it in a web browser. 

ENCODING METADATA.

Add some description information to your file. 

- 

Add some bibliographic information to your file. 

- 
<bibl>

In the meantime you can try again with visualization and publication to see the changes you included.

DID YOU FINISH ALREADY?

Violante or Violente? 'Violente' in the Polish version is a typo, so go for it and encode the correction.

- Search in the TEI Guidelines for a solution looking for 'choice' (<choice>, <sic>, <corr>).

DID YOU FINISH ALREADY (AGAIN)?

The first letter in the original is highlighted. Do we encode it?

- Search in the TEI Guidelines for a solution looking for 'hi' (<hi>) and the attribute @rend.


* I provided you with the XML-TEI file already done. Feel free to have a look or ask me for help.
